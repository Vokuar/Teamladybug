![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/995680734847193168.webp) Download, install, and set up ATLauncher (https://atlauncher.com/downloads). 

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/995680734847193168.webp) Download either the CurseForge or the MultiMC version of the modpack, since ATLauncher supports both. Do not extract it.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/995680734847193168.webp) Open ATLauncher, go to "Instances" on the right, and click "Import" in the top left corner.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/995680734847193168.webp) Click "Browse", select the modpack .zip you downloaded, and import it. 

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/995680734847193168.webp) Go back to ATLauncher, click "Settings" on the newly imported modpack, go to "Java/Minecraft", and ensure sufficient maximum RAM (6000-8000).
